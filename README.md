# Building-LSTM-from-Scratch-in-R
Building simple LSTM from scratch without using Keras or Pytorch or any Neural Network packages in R.
This model try to do binary text classification.
This project still contains lots of bugs (Incompleted).

This project was built in order to understand how LSTM works when I was completing my Thesis.
