# Building-LSTM-from-Scratch-in-R
Building simple LSTM from scratch without using Keras or Pytorch or any Neural Network packages in R.
This model try to do binary text classification.
All the reference I used is in Python so I try to create it in R.
This project still contains lots of bugs (Incompleted). 

This project was built in order to understand how LSTM works when I was completing my Thesis.
