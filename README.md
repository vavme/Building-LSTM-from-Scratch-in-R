# Building-LSTM-from-Scratch-in-R
Building simple LSTM from scratch without using Keras or Pytorch or any Neural Network packages in R. <br/>
This model try to do binary text classification. 
All the reference I used is in Python so I try to create it in R. <br/>
This project still contains some bugs on the backpropation that causes the model cant learn properly. <br/>
This project was built in order to understand how LSTM works when I was completing my Thesis.
The progess is 90% completed. <br/>
